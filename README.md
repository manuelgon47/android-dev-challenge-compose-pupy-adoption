# Template repository

Template repository for the Jetpack Compose [#AndroidDevChallenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge).

## Week #1 - Puppy adoption app
Let‚Äôs start the #AndroidDevChallenge with a bang bark: build a puppy adoption app! The app should contain an overview screen that displays a list of puppies, and a detail screen showing each puppy's details. You have until March 2nd, 23:59 PST to submit your entry. 2

Your UI must be fully built in Compose. Your submission will only be judged based on your app‚Äôs UI layer. To help you with the implementation, check out the Compose documentation on layouts, lists, text and navigation. For some paws-on learning try out the Compose pathway, with codelabs covering several topics useful in completing this challenge.

Are you a üê±rather than a üê∂ person? Submissions for any type of pet adoption app are welcomed.

We look forward to seeing what you build!

## Code formatting
The CI uses [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) to check if your code is formatted correctly and contains the right licenses.
Internally, Spotless uses [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) to check the formatting of your code.
To set up ktlint correctly with Android Studio, follow one of the [listed setup options](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint#-with-intellij-idea).

Before committing your code, run `./gradlew app:spotlessApply` to automatically format your code.
